As a Track and Cross Country athlete, I wanted a free and easy way to simulate meets to help our team gain more insight on what we'd be facing. This extension aims to help coaches and athletes alike do exactly that

## Installation

### Via the Chrome Web Store

Go to [the Athletic Helper listing on the Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/athletic-helper/gdnmapolllodbicoalbfpainmldmabek) and click Add Extension.
